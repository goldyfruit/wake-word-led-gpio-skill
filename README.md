A light indicator for Mycroft on Raspberry Pi

## About

The [Raspberry Pi](https://rapsberrypi.org) is a tiny and affordable computer that you can use to interact with `GPIO` (General Purpose Input/Output) such as button, sensor, LED, etc...

This skill interacts with a LED to let you know if Mycroft is listening. When a wake word is detected the LED is turning on and when the recording is done the LED is turning off.

## Examples

There is no example because there is no interaction with the Mycroft.

## Configuration

This skill utilizes the `skillsettings.json` file which allows you to configure this skill via `home.mycroft.ai` after a few seconds of having the skill installed you should see something like below in the https://home.mycroft.ai/#/skill location:
